== Frequently Asked Questions ==
How do I reorganize my menu?

Once the plugin is activated,  navigate to the \"Admin Menu Organizer\" page in your side menu. From there you can drag and drop the menu items in the order that you like them.

I\'ve reorganized my menu but I don\'t see the changes reflected in my admin.

Make sure you have switched the menu on. Check the button at the top of the  \"Admin Menu Organizer\" page. If it is red, then your menu is switched off. After that, your reorganized menu should be visible when you next refresh the page. 

Can I switch it off?

Yes, on the \"Admin Menu Organizer\" page at the top there is a button to toggle the system on or off. 

Can I change the appearance of the menu?

Yes, in the \"Admin Menu Organizer\" submenu there is a page called \"User Settings\". From here you can configure the menu width, colors, padding etc.

Which roles can use the plugin?

By default, any user that can log in to the admin area can use the plugin and configure it for their convenience. However if you wish to restrict it to certain users, e.g. administrators only, then you can select a minimum role in the \"Admin Menu Organizer\" submenu there is a page called \"Global Settings\" submenu.
